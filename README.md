# 4DED
  4DED, which stands for 4 Dimensions Equally Divided, is a game with 2 spatial dimensions and 2 temporal dimensions. Physics is different in both temporal dimensions, and you can choose which to traverse by moving in the spatial dimensions, and quite easily because you are a photon going the speed of light.

  Things like magnets changing forces and beings choosing different temporal paths than you are commonly found here.
